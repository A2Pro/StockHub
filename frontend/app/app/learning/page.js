      content: `Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you purchase a share of a company, you are buying a small piece of that company, also known as equity. As a shareholder, you have the potential to benefit from the company's growth and profitability. Companies issue stocks to raise money for expansion, operations, or other business needs.

Investing in stocks means you are betting on the companyâ€™s future success. If the company performs well, its stock price typically rises, increasing the value of your investment. Conversely, if the company struggles, the stock price can fall. This is why understanding a company before investing is crucial.

Public companies are listed on stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ. These platforms allow investors to buy and sell shares easily.

Stocks are typically categorized into two main types: common and preferred. Common stocks offer voting rights at shareholder meetings and potential dividends, while preferred stocks prioritize dividend payments but usually lack voting rights. Understanding this distinction helps investors choose the type of stock that aligns with their financial goals.

In addition, companies may issue different classes of stock that confer varying levels of control or financial benefits. These classifications are vital for investors analyzing company structures and potential influence on decision-making processes.`,

      title: "Lesson 2: How Stocks Make Money",
      content: `Stocks generate returns through two main ways: capital gains and dividends. Capital gains occur when you buy a stock at a lower price and sell it at a higher price. Dividends are portions of a companyâ€™s profits paid regularly to shareholders. Not all companies pay dividends, especially high-growth companies that reinvest profits back into growth.

Investors also benefit from stock appreciation driven by market demand, company performance, and economic growth. Long-term investors often aim to combine both income (dividends) and capital growth in their portfolios.`,
      questions: [
        { q: "What are the two primary ways stocks generate returns?", options: ["Dividends and capital gains", "Loans and debts", "Taxes and subsidies", "Fees and penalties"], correct: 0 },
        { q: "Which companies typically reinvest profits?", options: ["Startups", "High-growth companies", "Government agencies", "Banks"], correct: 1 }

      title: "Lesson 3: Understanding Stock Market Risks",
      content: `Investing in stocks involves risks at multiple levels including market risk and company-specific risk. Market risk is the possibility of an overall market downturn impacting most stocks. Company-specific risk arises from poor management decisions, financial instability, or regulatory changes.

Diversifying investments across sectors, regions, and asset classes reduces risk exposure. External factors like political events, economic cycles, and interest rates also influence market risks.`,
      questions: [
        { q: "What is a common way to reduce risk?", options: ["Buy one stock", "Diversify investments", "Invest only in crypto", "Avoid all markets"], correct: 1 },

    {
      title: "Lesson 4: Stock Market Basics and Indexes",
      content: `The stock market includes exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ where investors buy and sell shares. Indexes like the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and NASDAQ Composite track the performance of selected groups of stocks and represent the marketâ€™s general health.

Index funds allow investors to buy a slice of the entire market. These funds help diversify portfolios and are widely used in passive investing strategies to match the marketâ€™s return rather than beating it.`,
      questions: [
        { q: "What does the S&P 500 represent?", options: ["500 government projects", "500 U.S. large companies", "500 startup ideas", "500 bonds"], correct: 1 },
        { q: "What is the purpose of a stock index?", options: ["Predict weather", "Track performance of groups of stocks", "Calculate taxes", "Print money"], correct: 1 }

      title: "Lesson 5: Long-Term Investing and Patience",
      content: `Successful stock investing requires patience and discipline. Time in the market often beats timing the market. Long-term investors ride out market volatility and benefit from compound growth over years.

Strategies like dollar-cost averagingâ€”investing fixed amounts regularlyâ€”help smooth out market fluctuations. Emotional control is key to avoid selling during downturns and missing potential recoveries.`,

        { q: "Why is long-term investing important?", options: ["Guarantees profit", "Avoids taxes", "Rides out volatility", "Eliminates fees"], correct: 2 },
